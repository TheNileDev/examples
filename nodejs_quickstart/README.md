# Minimal NodeJS Example

This is the slighly longer version of [Nile's quickstart](https://docs.thenile.dev/docs/current/quick-start), written in NodeJS.
It isn't extremely useful on its own, but a good start if you want to play around with Nile APIs in NodeJS.

## To run this project:

0. Install dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

1. Execute:
```
ts-node index.ts
```
